# MEP Email Campaign Script

This script sends personalized attendance reports to MEPs in their respective languages, promoting transparency and accountability.

## Features

- **Multi-language support**: Emails sent in the MEP's country's primary language
- **Personalized content**: Each email includes the MEP's specific attendance statistics
- **Smart filtering**: Automatically skips MEPs on sick leave or with special roles
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents spam filter issues
- **Comprehensive logging**: Tracks success/failure rates

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 2. Configure Email Settings
Edit `email_config.json`:
```json
{
  "smtp": {
    "server": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "username": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "password": "your-app-password",
    "from_email": "your-email@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

### 3. Gmail Setup (if using Gmail)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password" for this script
3. Use the app password (not your regular password)

### 4. Get Real Email Addresses
The script currently uses placeholder emails (`mep-{id}@europarl.europa.eu`). You'll need to:
1. Research actual MEP email addresses
2. Update the `load_mep_data()` function
3. Or create a separate CSV with email mappings

## Usage

### Test Mode (Recommended First)
```bash
python email_meps.py
```
This will print all emails to console without sending them.

### Production Mode
1. Edit `email_meps.py` and uncomment the actual sending lines
2. Set `test_mode: false` in `email_config.json`
3. Run: `python email_meps.py`
